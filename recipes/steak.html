        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">Thai flavors combine to make one phenomenal steak! Flank steak is my favorite, 
            but it's also great for other cuts of meat.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class=ingredients>
            <li>¼ cup chili sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup fish sauce</li>
            <li>1½ tablespoons dark sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
            <li>2 pounds flank steak</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>Steps</h3>   
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together chili sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, ginger, and 
                garlic. Set aside a few tablespoons of the mixture for brushing the steaks during 
                grilling. Score flank steak and place in a shallow dish. Pour remaining marinade 
                over the steak, and turn to coat. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least
                3 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.</li>
            <li>Lightly brush the grilling surface with oil. Grill steak 5 minutes per side, or to 
                desired doneness, brushing frequently with the reserved marinade mixture.</li>
        </ol>
